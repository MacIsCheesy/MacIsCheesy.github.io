<h1> Hail Earendil </h1>
<p> of mariners most renowned, the looked for that cometh at unawares, the longed for that cometh beyond hope! <br>
  Hail EÃ¤rendil, bearer of light before the Sun and Moon! <br>
  Splendour of the Children of Earth, star in the darkness, jewel in the sunset, radiant in the morning!" </p>
