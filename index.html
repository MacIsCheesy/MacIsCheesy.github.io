	<h2> <br>ART APPRECIATION ESSAY </h2>
	<h2> Christianity's Perspective On Art </h2>
	<h3> Made by: Ignasius Alvin Yo, Kevin Reinaldi, Sherlyn Chang (5A5) </h3>
	<h3> Due: 27 November 2014 </h3>
	<p> &emsp As we know, art originally comes from human and it is a synonym of knowledge. In <br>
		this modern period, we can see art of the essence of expression and human creativity. Art is <br>
		very hard to be explained and also to be rated. Because each artist chooses the rule and <br>
		parameters which leads their work by itself. Art is the expression or application of human <br>
		creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, <br>
		producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty of emotional power. Art begins <br>
		when one person, with the object of joining another or others to himself in one and the same <br>
		feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications. The are various feelings of the <br>
		artists that may infect others like feelings love one's own country, self devotion and <br>
		submission to fate or to God expressed in a drama, and many more.
